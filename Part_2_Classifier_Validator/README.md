by Johnny Vo and Diego Vega

To run the program, please compile the code by typing: g++ main.cpp classifier.cpp validator.cpp
Then execute the program.

If you need to enable the trace/clock for the Classifier::test(), remove the comments within the test() function in classifier.cpp

To test the different features, please change the "features" vector. Please consider the amount of features within the small and large data sets when changing the values in the vector:
Small Dataset (Has 100 instances and 10 features)
Large Dataset (Has 1000 instances, and 40 features)
